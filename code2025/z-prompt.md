Prompt:

Make a php, node or python backend that when the link is clicked the single file will ALWAYS generate a webpage with the heading "magic word" that has a textbox with the value "fred" in it and a submit button. When submitted the same file then reads the textbox and generates "Magic word found" if it matches "fred" and gives the hint "Try fred" if it does not match.

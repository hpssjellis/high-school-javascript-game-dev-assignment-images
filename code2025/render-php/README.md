Load these files in a new render project or even easier load this repo

https://github.com/hpssjellis/render-php

In render settings set the language to Docker



Note: A much more powerful PHP Dockerfile is in this repository   https://github.com/hpssjellis/render-node-power  as it can run from PHP both Node and Python commands. Basically allowing you to do anything from a backend. Not sure if this is safe but it doees work.

Something we have not done is activate a noSQL or mySQL database that would be an interesting project for someone to try.

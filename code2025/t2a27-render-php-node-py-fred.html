<h1>t2a27-render-php-node-py-fred.html</h1>


Make three webservices using render.com and have this page link to the final working
pages which all take a magic word and reply only if the word is "fred" 


For easy setup on render you can fork each of the three repositories

1. https://github.com/hpssjellis/render-php
1. https://github.com/hpssjellis/render-node
1. https://github.com/hpssjellis/render-py


Then below here put the links to your working code, or put it into a sensible table with the github links above.
